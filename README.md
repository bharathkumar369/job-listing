### What I learned

i have learned logic behind search input to render the leayout.

```
    const filterJobs = data.filter((jobs) => {
        
        const roleMatch = jobs.position.toLowerCase().includes(props.searchInput.toLowerCase());
        
        const languageMatch = jobs.languages.some((language) => 
            language.toLowerCase().includes(props.searchInput.toLowerCase())
        );
        
        const levelMatch = jobs.level.toLowerCase().includes(props.searchInput.toLowerCase());

        const toolsMatch = jobs.tools.some((tools)=> tools.toLowerCase().includes(props.searchInput.toLowerCase()))
        
        return roleMatch || languageMatch || levelMatch || toolsMatch;
    })
```
